msgid "The easiest way to solve the problem consists in flying at a height of 10 meters, aiming downward with <c/>aim(-20);<n/>, and approaching the ant with a conditional loop as long as the <a cbot|dist>distance</a> is greater than 20m. In this conditional loop, you must look for the closest ant, turn towards it, set the motors at full speed with <c/>motor(1,1);<n/>, and wait a little, for example 0.2 seconds. All these instructions must be repeated until the ant is at less than 20 meters. Then just shoot it."
